Steps of Data Modelling and Training in ML.txt


E2E steps for any Data Science project:

1)Frame the Problem Statement

2)Get the data and read it

3)EDA

4)Preprocess

5)Feature Selection/Scaling/Engeneering

6)Model Training and Selection

7)Tuning the model

8)accuracy and metrics

9)Prediction

10)Deploy and Monitor




Hints :


1. check Target variable has imbalanced class distribution or not

2. explore the features (independent variables) before trying to build a model.

   first discover the features that only have two values.

3. change the values of target variable. "Yes" will be 1 and "No" will be 0.

4. For EDA check ## Binary categorical features and categorical features

5. Do Resampling

   The target variables with imbalanced class distribution is not desired for

   machine learning models. I will use upsampling which means increasing the 

   number of samples of the class with less samples by randomly selecting rows from it.
